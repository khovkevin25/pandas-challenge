# pandas-challenge

## Kevin Khov

In this challenge, we were tasked to analyze datasets to determine certain metrics with regards to schools within a city. Key metrics were found for each district, such as total unique schools, total students and average test scores, and each school, such as total school budget, total students and average test scores. The CSV files used in this analysis can be found under "schools_complete.csv" and "students_complete.csv" under the "Resources" folder.

Based on these metrics, various DataFrames and tables were created to determine metrics such as highest-performing schools by percentage of overall passing students and scores by school spending. The code to create these DataFrames and tables can be found in the file "PyCitySchools_main.ipynb".

A summary of the total analysis and the subsequent conclusions can be found at the top of "PyCitySchools_main.ipynb".
