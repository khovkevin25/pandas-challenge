## Kevin Khov

In this challenge, we were tasked to analyze datasets to determine certain metrics with regards to schools within a city. Key metrics were found for each district, such as total unique schools, total students and average test scores, and each school, such as total school budget, total students and average test scores.

Based on these metrics, various DataFrames and tables were created to determine metrics such as highest-performing schools by percentage of overall passing students and scores by school spending. These code to create these DataFrames and tables can be found in file "PyCitySchools_main.ipynb".

A summary of the analysis performed can be found in the file "PyCitySchools Analysis", which also includes two conclusions that can be made from the performed calculations.
